                    <h2 id="cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</h2>
                    We use cookies and similar tools on our website, to enhance your user experience and help us improve
                    our website. This policy explains how we do that.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
                    Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you
                    first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your
                    device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We
                    use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
                    <br/>There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username
                    and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content
                    we believe will be most relevant to you.
                    <br/>Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when
                    logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that
                    identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and
                    use our websites, or a user’s general location.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>What sort of cookies does <cite>Nouse</cite> use?</h3>
                    Generally, our cookies perform up to three different functions, in descending order of importance:
                    <br/><br/> <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
                    Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to
                    identify registered users and allow them to access the "back-end" sections of the website.
                    <br/><br/><h4>Functionality Cookies</h4>
                    We use functionality cookies to remember your preferences, to remember your name when you comment on
                    an article, and to remember whether you have voted in a poll.
                    <br/><br/><h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
                    We use other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website
                    performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and
                    quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies
                    to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most
                    effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Does anyone else use cookies on the <cite>Nouse</cite> website?</h3> Advertisers sometimes use
                    their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a
                    profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you with more relevant
                    advertisements during your visit to nouse.co.uk. We believe that it is useful to our users to see
                    advertisements that are more relevant to their interests.
                    <br/>We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the categories above. For
                    example, like many websites, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. When
                    you share an article on Facebook or Twitter using the buttons provided, third-party cookies may
                    again be used.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    <h3>Can a website user block cookies?</h3>
                    As we’ve explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our website.
                    <br/>However, if you do wish to disable our cookies then you might find the instructions found in <a
                            href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/privacy/cookies/managing/">this BBC article</a> helpful.
                    <br/>Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of
                    our website do not work properly.</p>
