                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>This is <cite>Nouse</cite>, the University of York&#8217;s largest, oldest, and best-known media outlet and one of the most highly-respected, nationally-acclaimed and award-winning student news providers in the country.</p>
                    <p><cite>Nouse</cite> experience represents an exceptionally valuable addition to any future journalist&#8217;s CV, recognised by industry experts nationwide.</p>
                    <p><cite>Nouse</cite> alumni who graduated just months ago are already working for the <cite>Financial Times</cite>, the <cite>Telegraph</cite> and the <cite>Times</cite>, while others have secured internships with national outlets such as the <cite>Guardian</cite>, <cite>Style</cite> and <cite>Wonderland</cite>. If you&#8217;re at all interested in training for the testing world of journalism during your time at University, there&#8217;s no better place.</p>
                    <p>Founded in 1964, making us the oldest society on campus, <cite>Nouse</cite> has consistently provided the student voice for generations of York students and an important critical voice of the University and the Students&#8217; Union.</p>
                    <p>Recent investigations into the University&#8217;s investment into the international arms trade led to divestment promises from the administration&#8217;s finance department and national acclaim, while a campaign to save campus porters lead by this newspaper ensured the survival of an important University service.</p>
                    <h3>YuStart</h3>
                    <p>In 2015, <cite>Nouse</cite> ran a successful YuStart campaign which raised over Â£1,000. We were grateful for the generosity of all our sponsors, but would like to thank Ben Crawley, Liam Dooley, Catherine Dunning and Kevin Murphy in particular.</p>
